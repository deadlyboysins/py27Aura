A warning message is a message output when the Message Queue Java client runtime experiences a problem
that should not occur under normal operating conditions. The message is displayed where the application
displays its output. Usually, this is the window from which the application is started.
Table A-1 lists Message Queue warning messages.

In general, a warning message does not cause message loss or affect reliability.issues.
But when warning messages appear constantly on the application's console,
the user should contact Message Queue technical support to diagnose the cause of the warning messages.
